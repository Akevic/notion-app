# notion-app
Linux notion.so app
Currently this is a work in progress. At this time it allows you to run an eletron app of Notion.so on your desktop.
A script been provided to create the "notion.desktop" file run creat_desktop_file.sh.
* To access notion as a native app you will want to place the "notion.desktop" file in your 
.local/share/applications folder the script does not do this for you as of yet.
Thank you for trying it out.
